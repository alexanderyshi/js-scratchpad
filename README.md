*learning javascript through the lens of WebGL*

The collection of scripts found within this serve as learning exercises with the Javascript Canvas API. 
These are quick hacks or small games made for fun, and thus were aggregated into one repo.

**Manifest**:
* Contemporary drawing exercise
* Spacewars (based on the original title from the 1960s, with modifications)
* Ice Cream Machine (based on the original game hosted on neopets.com)
